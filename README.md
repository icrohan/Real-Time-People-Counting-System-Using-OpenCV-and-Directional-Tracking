# üëÅÔ∏è Real-Time People Counting System Using OpenCV & Directional Tracking

A real-time, vision-based analytics system that detects, tracks, and counts people moving **in** and **out** of an enclosed space using advanced computer vision techniques. Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a direction-aware algorithm, this project bridges the gap between AI-powered video surveillance and smart occupancy management.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Detection & Tracking** of multiple individuals using OpenCV.
- üîÅ **Bidirectional Movement Analysis** for precise IN and OUT counting.
- ‚ö° **Fast and Lightweight**: Optimized for edge devices and laptops.
- üéØ **Customizable Zone Line** to define your count threshold (doorways, hallways).
- üíª **Live Visual Feedback** with bounding boxes, tracking lines, and counters.
- üîå Modular codebase ready for **IoT, cloud dashboards, or database** integration.

## üì∑ How It Works

> "Counting isn't just detection. It's understanding motion with context."

1. **Frame Capture**: Video input from webcam or IP camera.
2. **People Detection**: 
   - Option 1: HOG + SVM (fast & lightweight).
   - Option 2: MobileNet-SSD (deep learning-based, higher accuracy).
3. **Object Tracking**: Uses centroid tracking to persist identities across frames.
4. **Line Crossing Logic**: Counts based on trajectory across a virtual boundary line.
5. **Visual Output**: Annotated feed with direction arrows and counters.
